To begin: **Why did we decide to move from our previous repository VIVO?**

- **Increased Visibility:** VERSO makes research and creative projects more accessible and searchable online, enhancing their visibility.
- **Automated Updates:** Integrating with external platforms like **ORCID iD** and **Clarivateâ€™s** extensive data index, VERSO automates research output updates and streamlines profile management through regularly harvesting these databases. 
    - *"Data Harvesting*", put simply, is the process of automatically gathering information from digital sources to organize and centralize this data, in this case, in VERSO.
- **Departmental Support:** VERSO provides analytics to promote department work and preserves research-related products, helping to prevent data loss during faculty or student transitions.

Another reason the library is developing VERSO is the **breadth of scholarly output it can showcase**. Along with traditional materials like theses, dissertations and peer reviewed articles, VERSO also highlight undervalued output such as:

- **Creative Works:**
    - Artwork, music compositions, performance recordings, etc.
- **Software and Code:**
    - Source code, algorithms, software tools and datasets created by researchers
- **Educational Materials:**
    - Courseware, instructional videos, presentations, and other teaching aids	
- **Media Appearances:**
    - Interviews, podcasts, or other media engagements highlighting research.
- **Outreach Activities:**
    - Public engagement efforts, such as workshops, events, or community service related to research.
