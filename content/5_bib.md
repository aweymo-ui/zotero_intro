To create a bibliography of a collection, simply select some or all of the items you would like, right click and select `Create Bibliography from Items.` This will open a pop-up window that will give you a list of 15 of the most popular styles by default (although selecting the `Manage Styles` link below this box will open up the setting where you can add or remove styles as needed). This pop-up also allows you to select your preferred language, choose between in-line citation or endnote bibliography formatting and choose the output method between a Rich Text File, HTML, print (or save to PDF) and, what I choose most, copy to clipboard – which I will paste into my document when I’m finished.

Right clicking selected items also gives me the option to `Create Report from Items`, which may be requested from professors at some point. The difference between this and the bibliography is that it defaults to exporting all of your metadata for each item, including tags and attachments which you can `Save As` either a PDF or HTML file.

Finally, another great feature for creating summaries between collections is the `Create Notes from Annotations` command, which will scan all of your PDF files and generate a note document with only your highlighted sections ending with an already formatted citation including the author’s name, the date of publishing and the page it was extracted from. Note that this will be the page of the PDF file, not necessarily the number that it reads at the top of the original page, but these are easily editable within the notes file.

## Connecting Zotero to Web Based Word Processors

One feature that Zotero promotes but I’ve never had too much luck with is adding Extensions to Google Docs and Microsoft Word to automatically generate citations in your document. Perhaps due to errors in the Application Programming Interface (or API) that would allow the two programs to exchange information and perform tasks without having to understand the underlying code of the other system, I have never been able to get this extension to function for me and have a similar experience when attempting to link Zotero to the personal research tool Obsidian. 

That said, the time difference between opening your extension in Google Docs, selecting the collection you would like a citation from and just opening your Zotero app, copying the bibliography to your clipboard and pasting into the same document is basically negligible.
