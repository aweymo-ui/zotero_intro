## Information Architecture

Now that all of your software is connected, the first step to building your collections is considering how you want to organize your research material. One of the most straightforward ways you might choose to organize a folder, subfolder collection is chronologically. 

**For example:**

#### Science Class (Chronological Organization)
- Course 1
  - Week 1
    - Lecture Notes
    - Assigned Readings
  - Week 2
    - Lab Report: Photosynthesis
    - Articles: Plant Cell Function
- Course 2
  - Week 1
    - Lecture Notes: Genetics
    - Assigned Readings
  - Week 2
    - Lab Report: DNA Extraction
    - Articles: CRISPR Technology

<br>

**Another way to organize is project based organization, such as:**

#### History PhD Research (Project-Based Organization)
- Dissertation
  - Chapter 1: Introduction
    - Key Sources
    - Theoretical Framework
  - Chapter 2: The Revolution
    - Primary Sources
    - Secondary Sources
- Conference Presentations
  - 2024 History Symposium
    - Sources on Colonial America
    - Presentation Outline
  - 2025 World History Conference
    - Draft Paper: Economic Impacts
    - Bibliography
- Publications
  - Journal Article: "Revolutionary Networks"
    - Drafts
    - Peer-Reviewed Sources

<br>

**Yet another way is through the different types of methodological frameworks that your research utilizes, such as:**

#### Sociology Research (Methodological Framework Organization)
- Qualitative Research
  - Ethnography
    - Field Notes: Rural Communities
    - Case Studies
  - Interviews
    - Transcripts
    - Coding Framework
- Quantitative Research
  - Surveys
    - Questionnaire Design
    - Response Data
  - Statistical Analysis
    - Regression Models
    - Demographic Reports
- Mixed Methods
  - Comparative Studies
    - Case vs. Control Groups
    - Interdisciplinary Approaches
  - Literature Review
    - Articles on Mixed Methods
    - Annotated Bibliography

Other organizational approaches include grouping references by the type of resources they are (`Books, Journal Articles, Web Resources, etc.`), citation priority organization (`Must Cite, Further Reading, Background Information, etc.`) and stage-of-research organization (`Literature Review, Data Analysis, Publication, etc.`) No one way is better than another; they simply need to best suit what scholarly output you would like to produce and the format that is most intuitive to you as a researcher. 

On a technical level, to create a new collection or subcollection, either select `File` from the menu and `New Collection`, or simply right click `My Library` on the left pane of the application and start building out your collection structure.

## Importing Files

Once you have an idea of how to best organize your material, let’s begin filling it in with documents. Another powerful feature of Zotero that can help you save a massive amount of time in citation management is its `Retrieve Metadata` feature. If you drop one or many PDF files in your collection, Zotero will automatically scan these documents for a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), PubMed ID (PMID), or other metadata embedded in the file. The software will then query external databases such as CrossRef, Pubmed and Google Scholar that contain bibliographic details of the work’s title, author, publication year, etc. and fill in these items, creating a parent item for the PDF file and differentiating item type depending on if the item is a book, journal article, newspaper article or any of the other 35 qualifiers Zotero distinguishes.

Note: The `Retrieve Metadata` feature and Zotero in general is meant to work with PDF files rather than DOC or TXT files. While these files will import into a collection metadata retrieval, citation formatting and exporting DOC files are prone to corruption. Safe and freely available ways to convert DOC and TXT files to PDF include:

- Upload the DOC or TXT file to your Google Drive.
- Open the file with Google Docs.
- From the "File" menu, choose Download > PDF Document (.pdf).

 **Or**

- Open the DOC file in Microsoft Word (available to students as part of the Office 365 suite).
- Select File > Save As.
- Choose PDF as the format and save.

While the `Retrieve Metadata` feature is helpful, it is really only as good as the document you feed into it. If the paper is missing a DOI (as any non-peer reviewed items will be) this metadata will not generate. The foolproof process I like to do when importing is to visit a page that is guaranteed to have all of the metadata I need for my resource, such as the [University of Idaho Library Catalog](https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01ALLIANCE_UID:UID&mode=simple){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [WorldCat](https://search.worldcat.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, selecting Zotero Connector from the Extensions tab in my browser to create a parent file for the document, and then dropping my PDF file into it. 

For items that may not have a web presence such as presentations, conference papers and hearings, you can also add files manually by going to the menu and selecting `File` > `New Item` or selecting the green plus sign along the top of the application and picking the appropriate item type.  

<br>

## Duplicating and Removing Items

If you would like to have the same document in two separate collections, simply drag the item into your preferred folder. This won’t remove the file from the current folder but you will now be able to see it in the Duplicate Items folder, which will be at the bottom of your organizational tree. The other important default folder to note is the Trash. Within collections you have the option to both `Remove Item from Collection` to erase a single instance of a document and `Move Item to Trash` to send all available copies to the trash. **This doesn’t automatically delete the document though!** 

Zotero is (maybe rightfully) skittish about accidentally deleting research. To do this, visit the Trash folder, select items, right click and select `Delete Permanently` to remove from both your cloud storage and the local storage on your device. Alternatively, you can also select items, right click and select `Return to Library` to recover these documents.

## Data Limits

This is an appropriate time to mention that **Zotero is free up to 300 MB**, after which tiered storage is available at a subscription fee. There is also a functionality to link your Zotero storage with a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) service, which the more technically adept may be interested in reading [more about here](https://www.zotero.org/support/sync){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. For the majority of you, remembering to remove duplicate items, emptying your trash folder and regularly exporting collections once a semester or project ends before deleting those items from your collection should be sufficient to maintain a completely free Zotero account.
