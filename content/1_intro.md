Hello, my name is [Andrew Weymouth](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/aweymouth.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and I work at the University of Idaho Library as the Digital Initiatives Librarian in the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL)](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} department. My work generally consists of [creating and maintaining our digital collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, helping to rethink processes and introducing new digital scholarship tools to the department. More pertinent to this presentation, I am also the [new CALS liaison](https://aweymo-ui.github.io/cals_intro/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for the library beginning as of fall 2024.

Iâ€™m here today to talk about [VERSO](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/verso/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which stands for Vandal Expertise, Research, and Scholarship Online, which is being developed and maintained by [Associate Dean Research and Instruction Devin Becker](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/dbecker.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Unit Head for Research and Experiential Learning Jeremy Kenyon](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/jkenyon.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and team. 

**The platform serves two important purposes:**

- As a **Research Information Management** (RIM) system, it collects, publishes, and preserves data about research and creative activities at the university

- As an **Institutional Repository** (IR), it allows faculty, students, and staff to deposit and preserve publications and materials

This dual function makes VERSO a vital resource for advancing the visibility of your work, ensuring its digital preservation and connecting you with potential collaborators. 
Note that VERSO is this team's iteration of the ExLibris platform [ESPLORO](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Esploro){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which you may see me linking to at various points in this presentation for documentation.
