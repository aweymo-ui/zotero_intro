**The system is designed to balance visibility and [privacy](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/verso/faq.html#:~:text=How%20do%20you%20deal%20with%20privacy%3F){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**, ensuring that only professional data is showcased publicly. If, **for any reason**, you would like a work to be hidden from your public profile, go into your `Output` tab, select the ellipses next to the work and select `Hide This Work`.

{% include gallery-figure.html img="verso_10.gif" alt="Screen capture demonstration of how to hide various features of your page" caption="How to hide various features of your page" width="100%" %}

Additionally, you can hide things like `Previous Affiliations` within the `Edit Profile` tab, which will retain the information but remove it from the public view. **We only harvest professional data related to research, scholarship, and faculty status at the University of Idaho**. Student data is not deliberately included unless a specific written request by the student is made.

**We take individual privacy seriously**. Any request to be removed from the *public portal* will be granted; contact Jeremy Kenyon ([jkenyon@uidaho.edu](jkenyon@uidaho.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) to do so. However, your scholarship data will still be in the system for use in university research analytics; requests for complete removal must be submitted in writing to the [Dean of Libraries](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/bhunter.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
