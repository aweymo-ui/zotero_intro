        "text": "Hello, my name is Andrew Weymouth and I work at the University of Idaho Library as the Digital Initiatives Librarian in the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) department. My work generally consists of creating and maintaining our digital collections, helping to rethink processes and introducing new digital scholarship tools to the department. Use Case As a student, keeping track of a huge amount of research material can feel impossible. Have you ever been working on a paper and you have the perfect example that you would like to use but you have no idea what the name of the paper or site where you saw that information? Have you ever accidentally assumed a paper needed to be in one citation style that was actually another and needed to take hours tediously reworking in-line and end note formatting? Considering how difficult it is to organize a firehose of information you receive over the course of a semester, now imagine how difficult it will be when you need to find that book passage, scholarly journal or web site (which may or may not exist anymore) years afterwards when you are finishing your undergraduate degree, creating a master’s thesis or attempting a phD. Zotero is a good solution for all of these challenges you will encounter in your studies. Overview Zotero is an open source reference management software developed by the Corporation for Digital Scholarship (formerly by the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University) in 2006. Since jumping from an academic tool to incorporation in 2013, the software has gained widespread adoption by academics, students and researchers as a more versatile and digital preservation focused alternative to proprietary alternatives like EndNote and Mendeley. This workshop will show you how to set up your account, add browser plug-ins, survey different methods for annotating your research materials and searching between documents, using Zotero to create bibliographies, creating collaborative collections for group projects and exporting collections. If you have any questions about the material I cover here, always feel free to reach out to me at aweymouth@uidaho.edu."

        "text": "Contents: Installing Desktop Application | Installing Browser Plug-In | Using Zotero Connector and “Snapshot” Function | Tablets and Mobile Devices To begin, first create an account by visiting the user login page and selecting Register for a Free Account, where you will create a username, add email and password. Once you validate the email you entered, you should be all set with your free account! Installing Desktop Application Now visit the downloads page and select the desktop app icon on the left. On Windows, simply run the setup program Zotero provides. On a Mac the only step you need to do is to drag your .dmg file from the downloads folder into your applications folder before opening. If you happen to be on Linux, please reference these setup instructions provided by Zotero. Once you open the desktop application for the first time, go to your menu, select Zotero &gt; Settings &gt; Sync &gt; Link Account, where you will be prompted to enter your username and password you just created. Once this is complete, close the settings pop-up and click the green circular arrow button on the top right of the application to test syncing. Considering you just created an account and have no items, this shouldn’t take long – ut as long as you don’t have a little red exclamation mark that appears at the end of the sync, you should be set up! Note: If you have multiple desktops and laptops that you would like to use with your Zotero account, this is no problem! There is no maximum number of “chairs” a user with a free account can access. Simply download on the new device and enter your username and password again in the settings to sync between multiple devices. Installing Browser Plug-In Now let’s return to the downloads page and select the icon on the right to install the browser plug-in. This will take you over to various web stores depending on whether you are using Chrome, Safari, Firefox or another web browser. Select add to plug-ins and you should be all set. While there are some customizable options you can configure by selecting the Extensions icon in your browser window &gt; Ellipses &gt; Options, the unmodified setup is very straightforward. If you would like to save a web page to a collection, simply have your desktop Zotero application open and have the collection you would like the page saved to selected. Then select Extensions and select the Zotero icon. Using Zotero Connector and “Snapshot” Function First, this will add a web page item to your collection, scraping any available title, author, Abstract, URL, accessed date, language and rights information that is available on the page. Second, a “child” item will be added below this “parent” as a “snapshot.” This item contains the web page’s HTML content and associated images, CSS and any scripts necessary to run the page. If you open the snapshot directly from the Zotero, you will notice in this image that the URL in the browser is actually just my local Zotero storage drive. This means that I can access this content without an internet connection and it will remain accessible even if the original web page has been modified or deleted in the future. Having this feature automated is an incredibly helpful backup for your research findings as links eventually rot or pages that were once discoverable are buried by Search Engine Optimization that favors commercial rather than scholarly results. Tablets and Mobile Devices While there are some variances depending on the type of tablet or mobile device you are using, Zotero has a variety of options for accessing your collections on tablet or mobile devices either through Zotero or third party apps. Here is the breakdown of those applications: Option iOS Android iPhone Features Limitations Download Links Zotero Mobile App ✅ Official ✅ Official ✅ Yes Manage library, annotate PDFs, sync collections Limited compared to desktop Zotero iOS / Android Zotero Web Library ✅ Browser ✅ Browser ✅ Yes Access metadata, add/edit items Requires internet, no offline access or PDF tools Web Access PaperShip ✅ Third-Party ❌ Not Available ✅ Yes Annotate PDFs, organize collections Subscription for some features, iOS only iOS ZotEZ² ❌ Not Available ✅ Third-Party ❌ No Basic library access, PDF reading Outdated interface, limited updates Android Zoo for Zotero ❌ Not Available ✅ Third-Party ❌ No Simple and easy Zotero library access Lacks advanced features Android Zandy ❌ Not Available ✅ Third-Party ❌ No View and edit library Basic functionality, infrequent updates Android These applications are great for being able to always have research materials on hand but they are also helpful for different levels of study. While you might want to do more intensive highlighting and annotation for some research materials on your laptop or desktop, some materials that you may only need to skim are easily read on the go by using any of the mobile applications listed above along with a text to speech reader that are now available at no extra charge on any modern smartphone."

        "title": "Building Collections",
        "text": "Contents: Information Architecture | Importing Files | Duplicating and Removing Items | Data Limits Information Architecture Now that all of your software is connected, the first step to building your collections is considering how you want to organize your research material. One of the most straightforward ways you might choose to organize a folder, subfolder collection is chronologically. For example: Science Class (Chronological Organization) Course 1 Week 1 Lecture Notes Assigned Readings Week 2 Lab Report: Photosynthesis Articles: Plant Cell Function Course 2 Week 1 Lecture Notes: Genetics Assigned Readings Week 2 Lab Report: DNA Extraction Articles: CRISPR Technology Another way to organize is project based organization, such as: History PhD Research (Project-Based Organization) Dissertation Chapter 1: Introduction Key Sources Theoretical Framework Chapter 2: The Revolution Primary Sources Secondary Sources Conference Presentations 2024 History Symposium Sources on Colonial America Presentation Outline 2025 World History Conference Draft Paper: Economic Impacts Bibliography Publications Journal Article: “Revolutionary Networks” Drafts Peer-Reviewed Sources Yet another way is through the different types of methodological frameworks that your research utilizes, such as: Sociology Research (Methodological Framework Organization) Qualitative Research Ethnography Field Notes: Rural Communities Case Studies Interviews Transcripts Coding Framework Quantitative Research Surveys Questionnaire Design Response Data Statistical Analysis Regression Models Demographic Reports Mixed Methods Comparative Studies Case vs. Control Groups Interdisciplinary Approaches Literature Review Articles on Mixed Methods Annotated Bibliography &#10042; Other organizational approaches include grouping references by the type of resources they are (Books, Journal Articles, Web Resources, etc.), citation priority organization (Must Cite, Further Reading, Background Information, etc.) and stage-of-research organization (Literature Review, Data Analysis, Publication, etc.) No one way is better than another; they simply need to best suit what scholarly output you would like to produce and the format that is most intuitive to you as a researcher. On a technical level, to create a new collection or subcollection, either select File from the menu and New Collection, or simply right click My Library on the left pane of the application and start building out your collection structure. Importing Files Once you have an idea of how to best organize your material, let’s begin filling it in with documents. Another powerful feature of Zotero that can help you save a massive amount of time in citation management is its Retrieve Metadata feature. If you drop one or many PDF files in your collection, Zotero will automatically scan these documents for a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), PubMed ID (PMID), or other metadata embedded in the file. The software will then query external databases such as CrossRef, Pubmed and Google Scholar that contain bibliographic details of the work’s title, author, publication year, etc. and fill in these items, creating a parent item for the PDF file and differentiating item type depending on if the item is a book, journal article, newspaper article or any of the other 35 qualifiers Zotero distinguishes. Note: The Retrieve Metadata feature and Zotero in general is meant to work with PDF files rather than DOC or TXT files. While these files will import into a collection metadata retrieval, citation formatting and exporting DOC files are prone to corruption. Safe and freely available ways to convert DOC and TXT files to PDF include: Upload the DOC or TXT file to your Google Drive. Open the file with Google Docs. From the “File” menu, choose Download &gt; PDF Document (.pdf). Or Open the DOC file in Microsoft Word (available to students as part of the Office 365 suite). Select File &gt; Save As. Choose PDF as the format and save. While the Retrieve Metadata feature is helpful, it is really only as good as the document you feed into it. If the paper is missing a DOI (as any non-peer reviewed items will be) this metadata will not generate. The foolproof process I like to do when importing is to visit a page that is guaranteed to have all of the metadata I need for my resource, such as the University of Idaho Library Catalog or WorldCat, selecting Zotero Connector from the Extensions tab in my browser to create a parent file for the document, and then dropping my PDF file into it. For items that may not have a web presence such as presentations, conference papers and hearings, you can also add files manually by going to the menu and selecting File &gt; New Item or selecting the green plus sign along the top of the application and picking the appropriate item type. Duplicating and Removing Items If you would like to have the same document in two separate collections, simply drag the item into your preferred folder. This won’t remove the file from the current folder but you will now be able to see it in the Duplicate Items folder, which will be at the bottom of your organizational tree. The other important default folder to note is the Trash. Within collections you have the option to both Remove Item from Collection to erase a single instance of a document and Move Item to Trash to send all available copies to the trash. This doesn’t automatically delete the document though! Zotero is (maybe rightfully) skittish about accidentally deleting research. To do this, visit the Trash folder, select items, right click and select Delete Permanently to remove from both your cloud storage and the local storage on your device. Alternatively, you can also select items, right click and select Return to Library to recover these documents. Data Limits This is an appropriate time to mention that Zotero is free up to 300 MB, after which tiered storage is available at a subscription fee. There is also a functionality to link your Zotero storage with a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) service, which the more technically adept may be interested in reading more about here. For the majority of you, remembering to remove duplicate items, emptying your trash folder and regularly exporting collections once a semester or project ends before deleting those items from your collection should be sufficient to maintain a completely free Zotero account."

        "title": "Annotation, Searching and Creating Bibliographies",
        "text": "Contents: Within Zotero Desktop | Annotating in Word Processors | Searching in Zotero Within Zotero Desktop Along with the metadata Zotero retrieves that is visible in the Info tab for all of your documents, it also retrieves associated Tags, which are a bit like subject headings but more customizable. You can remove or add to these tags to help you quickly search for items across your organizational structure. Say you ordered your folders chronologically and by courses you are taking but you want to quickly find everything related to customized subjects. You could create tags such as “Medieval History,” “Climate Science”, “Critical Theory,” and so on. For annotations that don’t need to connect one work with another, you can visit the Notes tab of your document and select Add. There can really be anything that is helpful for future reference but I find that they are ideal for one to three sentence recaps after you finish reading so you have a personalized summary you can skim through as you look over a collection so you don’t need to open and dig through every document. These might include descriptions like, “only relevant in the final third,” “Good quotes.” Annotating in Word Processors If you go to your menu and select Zotero &gt; Settings &gt; General, the Open PDFs Using should be automatically set to Zotero’s internal word processor which is one of my least favorite elements of the software. While it has all of the highlight and annotation tools you would want in a word processor, it is crucial to keep in mind that these can only be viewed within the Zotero word processor. If you right click a document, select Show File and open this in another word processor, these elements will not be visible. While message boards cite technical limitations as the reason for this shortcoming, it’s an odd coincidence that this would also make researchers depend on Zotero if they ever want to see their notes. For non-proprietary digital preservation, I recommend going to your menu and selecting Zotero &gt; Settings &gt; General, the Open PDFs Using and select your preferred application for making notes in documents. These may include: Okular Totally open source with a wide array of customizable annotation tools Adobe Acrobat Clunkier, less customizable option Nitro PDF Pro Preferred option for overall customizability, PDF editing and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) but not open source – monthly subscription This configuration will open your documents in your preferred application where you can make your annotations for future reference, save and, once you push the green sync button in the Zotero, these changes will be reflected across all devices and, importantly, visible on any major word processor in the future. Searching in Zotero Searching either within or across your collections is easy to do even if it isn’t very evident in Zotero. To search across all collections, select My Library. Selecting the magnifying glass icon in the search bar, a menu will drop down that allows you to choose to search either Title, Creator, Year, All Fields and Tags or Everything, which will search the text within your documents if the documents are loaded with optical character recognition. To limit your search within specific collections and subcollections, simply select those areas and enter terms into the search bar."

        "title": "Creating Bibliographies, Reports and Notes from Annotations",
        "text": "To create a bibliography of a collection, simply select some or all of the items you would like, right click and select Create Bibliography from Items. This will open a pop-up window that will give you a list of 15 of the most popular styles by default (although selecting the Manage Styles link below this box will open up the setting where you can add or remove styles as needed). This pop-up also allows you to select your preferred language, choose between in-line citation or endnote bibliography formatting and choose the output method between a Rich Text File, HTML, print (or save to PDF) and, what I choose most, copy to clipboard – which I will paste into my document when I’m finished. Right clicking selected items also gives me the option to Create Report from Items, which may be requested from professors at some point. The difference between this and the bibliography is that it defaults to exporting all of your metadata for each item, including tags and attachments which you can Save As either a PDF or HTML file. Finally, another great feature for creating summaries between collections is the Create Notes from Annotations command, which will scan all of your PDF files and generate a note document with only your highlighted sections ending with an already formatted citation including the author’s name, the date of publishing and the page it was extracted from. Note that this will be the page of the PDF file, not necessarily the number that it reads at the top of the original page, but these are easily editable within the notes file. Connecting Zotero to Web Based Word Processors One feature that Zotero promotes but I’ve never had too much luck with is adding Extensions to Google Docs and Microsoft Word to automatically generate citations in your document. Perhaps due to errors in the Application Programming Interface (or API) that would allow the two programs to exchange information and perform tasks without having to understand the underlying code of the other system, I have never been able to get this extension to function for me and have a similar experience when attempting to link Zotero to the personal research tool Obsidian. That said, the time difference between opening your extension in Google Docs, selecting the collection you would like a citation from and just opening your Zotero app, copying the bibliography to your clipboard and pasting into the same document is basically negligible."

        "text": "Contents: Creating Collaborative Zotero Collections | Exporting Collections | Conclusion | About the Author Creating Collaborative Zotero Collections Another great feature that can help you during group projects, creating literature reviews and sharing resources with thesis and dissertation teams are Zotero’s Collaborative collections. To form a group, select the “Create a New Group” button on the groups landing page on zotero.org. You will be directed to a page where you can create a name for the group and designate the group as either public with open membership, public with closed membership and private, so the research materials are only visible to members you have invited. This will direct you to another stage where you can drill down on more visibility permissions as well as determining if you want everyone to have editing abilities for the materials. In some cases, you may want everyone to annotate and leave notes in a document to increase your knowledge base through communication but this will also leave documents vulnerable to being accidentally deleted depending on the technical abilities of your collaborators. Once this is configured to your liking, visit Group Settings to Edit group name, create a project description, choose an image for the collection, designate disciplines and link to a project site if that exists. From this page, visit Member Settings and select Send More Invitations, where you can add all of the email addresses or Zotero usernames of your group members individually or in one batch separated by commas. Once the project is finished, visit Group Settings and select Delete Group after exporting and saving the collection for future reference, which we will unpack in the final section… Exporting Collections The final step in the process so that you can both keep your storage bandwidth low (and free) and retain all of your research and associated notes and tagging is to export this data before erasing. Like generating the bibliography, select all of the items you plan on removing, right click and select Export Items. For ease of accessibility and digital preservation, I create two copies: one in the Zotero RDF format that I can drop back into Zotero at any point and one in CSV format that is a) non-proprietary, b) human readable, and c) widely supported by a variety of spreadsheet software platforms if Zotero decides to do something strange in the future. For both copies, make sure you check the boxes below to include notes, files and annotations. Once you have saved a copy to your external hard drive and/or cloud based storage, right click the collection, select Move to Trash, open the Trash folder, select items, right click and select Delete Permanently to remove from both web and local libraries. Conclusion Using this approach, Zotero is less like a permanent, constantly expanding library that you may not have the space to maintain but more like a warehouse floor. At the beginning of the semester, books, articles and web pages are poured all over the floor, Zotero helps you identify what everything is, you organize and annotate the material according to your needs, and once you’ve finished using the materials for the time being, Zotero will act like a trash compactor, compressing all of this work into a single, lightweight file that can be expanded again in the future if you ever need it. Then the warehouse floor is clean and ready for the next flood of information the following semester. I hope this has been an informative workshop.
