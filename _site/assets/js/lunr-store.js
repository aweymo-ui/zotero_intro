        "text": "Hello, my name is Andrew Weymouth and I work at the University of Idaho Library as the Digital Initiatives Librarian in the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) department. My work generally consists of creating and maintaining our digital collections, helping to rethink processes and introducing new digital scholarship tools to the department. More pertinent to this presentation, I am also the new CALS liaison for the library beginning as of fall 2024. &#10042; Navigating VERSO through research units. I’m here today to talk about VERSO, which stands for Vandal Expertise, Research, and Scholarship Online, which is being developed and maintained by Associate Dean Research and Instruction Devin Becker, Unit Head for Research and Experiential Learning Jeremy Kenyon and team. The platform serves two important purposes: As a Research Information Management (RIM) system, it collects, publishes, and preserves data about research and creative activities at the university As an Institutional Repository (IR), it allows faculty, students, and staff to deposit and preserve publications and materials This dual function makes VERSO a vital resource for advancing the visibility of your work, ensuring its digital preservation and connecting you with potential collaborators. Note that VERSO is this team’s iteration of the ExLibris platform ESPLORO, which you may see me linking to at various points in this presentation for documentation. &#10042;"

        "title": "Why VERSO?",
        "text": "To begin: Why did we decide to move from our previous repository VIVO? Increased Visibility: VERSO makes research and creative projects more accessible and searchable online, enhancing their visibility. Automated Updates: Integrating with external platforms like ORCID iD and Clarivate’s extensive data index, VERSO automates research output updates and streamlines profile management through regularly harvesting these databases. “Data Harvesting”, put simply, is the process of automatically gathering information from digital sources to organize and centralize this data, in this case, in VERSO. Departmental Support: VERSO provides analytics to promote department work and preserves research-related products, helping to prevent data loss during faculty or student transitions. Summary of VERSO's current repository holdings Another reason the library is developing VERSO is the breadth of scholarly output it can showcase. Along with traditional materials like theses, dissertations and peer reviewed articles, VERSO also highlight undervalued output such as: Creative Works: Artwork, music compositions, performance recordings, etc. Software and Code: Source code, algorithms, software tools and datasets created by researchers Educational Materials: Courseware, instructional videos, presentations, and other teaching aids Media Appearances: Interviews, podcasts, or other media engagements highlighting research. Outreach Activities: Public engagement efforts, such as workshops, events, or community service related to research. Highlighting these outputs ensures that all facets of your scholarship, including creative and public engagement activities, are recognized and valued. &#10042;"

        "text": "To access VERSO, simply log in using your University of Idaho credentials at verso.uidaho.edu. Once logged in, you can explore the platform, view your profile, and manage your research outputs. Even if this is your first time visiting the site, you will likely find your account has already been created and your scholarly work has already been attached to this profile due to being harvested from the following sources: Profile data and professional images are compiled from the University of Idaho website and Banner. Publications come from Clarivate’s Central Discovery Index, which in turn, gathers from sources such as Web of Science, Pubmed, Crossref and others. Grant data comes from individual submissions due to not currently being connected to UI’s internal grant system, Veras, for data harvesting, although we hope to add this data stream in the future. For instance: if you’ve published an article indexed in Web of Science and you have been a faculty member since this summer when initial data harvesting was done, VERSO likely already includes this information. &#10042; Locating and filling out the VERSO Profile Request form If you do not already have a profile due to potential gaps in this information or you are newer than the initial Banner data harvesting, you can request one by filling out the VERSO Profile Request Form. Within, you can add all of the elements of your CV, your preferred profile photo and all of the aspects of your academic work, which VERSO puts into the following categories: Output: Tangible research products such as publications, datasets, presentations, or other creative works that result from scholarly projects. Activities: Various professional or academic engagements, such as conference participation, workshops attended, or awards received. These activities help document the broader context of a researcher’s involvement in their field beyond their formal outputs. Projects: Overarching initiatives or research endeavors in which a researcher is involved. These can include funded research, collaborative efforts, or ongoing studies. &#10042;"

        "text": "Once you have a profile, you can easily adjust and add work to your VERSO site. Within the Edit Profile section, you can link ORCID or PubMed author ids, change profile pictures and adjust research topics and about sections. Adding Content Adding scholarly work to your profile Selecting the green Add Content button on the top right of the screen, you can add new output, activities and projects. While you are adding information to each entry, note that using clear descriptive keywords and other categorical metadata can help ensure your work reaches the widest audience. Researcher Proxies Adding a proxy who can add material for you in the future If you are leading a small team that are all working on the same projects and you would like to delegate updating profiles of all of the team members quarterly or biannually, you can go into the Edit Profile section, select Researcher Proxies and enter the email address of the person, thereby granting access to add future content on your page. &#10042; Timeline After submitting new content to your page, please note that everything is moderated before these new items are added to your profile. VERSO updates these items weekly and new faculty are added annually or upon receiving VERSO Request Forms. If you do have any questions around why a submitted project hasn’t been approved, select the ellipses on the right of the in process item, then Message, which will go directly to admin. Digital Object Identifiers If you would like a deposit to be given a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to create a permanent, citable reference, reach out to us. We have some limitations with the assignment of DOIs, but we can discuss on a case by case basis. Exporting How to export scholarly work to citation managers Once these works are approved and integrated into your profile, all or some of it can be easily exported in BibTeX and RIS bibliographic format which can then be dropped into reference managers like Zotero or EndNote. &#10042;"

        "text": "The system is designed to balance visibility and privacy, ensuring that only professional data is showcased publicly. If, for any reason, you would like a work to be hidden from your public profile, go into your Output tab, select the ellipses next to the work and select Hide This Work. How to hide various features of your page Additionally, you can hide things like Previous Affiliations within the Edit Profile tab, which will retain the information but remove it from the public view. We only harvest professional data related to research, scholarship, and faculty status at the University of Idaho. Student data is not deliberately included unless a specific written request by the student is made. We take individual privacy seriously. Any request to be removed from the public portal will be granted; contact Jeremy Kenyon (jkenyon@uidaho.edu) to do so. However, your scholarship data will still be in the system for use in university research analytics; requests for complete removal must be submitted in writing to the Dean of Libraries. &#10042;"

Seeing as this visualization only draws from the Web of Science database, we’re excited about VERSO’s potential to reveal richer insights by integrating data from multiple sources, including creative and public engagement contributions beyond peer-reviewed content. In closing, I encourage each of you to explore your VERSO profile today and start adding content to ensure your research is represented and preserved.
